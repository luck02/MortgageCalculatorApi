Mortgage insurance is required on all mortgages with less than 20% down.  Insurance must be calculated and added to the mortgage principal. Mortgage insurance is not available for mortgages > $1 million.

Mortgage insurance rates are as follows:
Downpayment	 Insurance Cost
5-9.99%		 3.15%
10.14.99%	 2.4%
15%-19.99%	 1.8%
20%+		 N/A

Payment formula: P = L[c(1 + c)^n]/[(1 + c)^n - 1]
P = Payment
L = Loan Principal
c = Interest Rate
n = Number of payments
